**I believe doing what you love is the only way to achieve great things.
I fell in love with programming because I realised that I can make an impact
on people by just using my imagination and passion when building applications.**

💜 Super passionate about building modern and creative websites that operate effectively.

🚀 I'm hard working, super curious, passionate, committed and a fast learner.

💪 I'm also a firm believer that we should never settle.
